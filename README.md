# 30 Days of Code 

https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code

#### [Day 0] Hello, World.

------------


To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

#### [Day 1] Data Types

------------


Complete the code in the editor below. The variables **i**,**d**, and **s**  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1.  Declare **3** variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2.  Read **3** lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
3.  Use the + operator to perform the following operations: 
   -  Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
   -   Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
  -   Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

**Note:** If you are using a language that doesn't support using  for string concatenation (e.g.: C), you can just print one variable immediately following the other on the same line. The string provided in your editor must be printed first, immediately followed by the string you read as input.

#### [Day 2] Operators

------------


Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

**Note:** Be sure to use precise valuaes for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

#### [Day 3] Intro to Conditional Statements

------------


Given an integer, **n**, perform the following conditional actions:

  * If **n** is odd, print **Weird**
  * If **n** is even and in the inclusive range of **2** to **5** , print **Not Weird**
  * If **n** is even and in the inclusive range of **6** to **20** , print **Weird**
  * If **n** is even and greater than **20** , print **Not Weird**
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not **n** is weird.

#### [Day 4] Arrays

------------


Write a Person class with an instance variable, **age** , and a constructor that takes an integer, **initialAge** , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as **initialAge** is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as **initialAge** , the constructor should set **age**  to **0** and print **Age is not valid, setting age to 0.**. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

1. yearPasses() should increase the ** age** instance variable by **1**.
2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
- If age < 13, print You are young..
- If age >= 13  and age < 18 , print You are a teenager..
- Otherwise, print You are old..
To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!

#### [Day 5] Loops

------------


Given an integer, **n** , print its first **10** multiples. Each multiple **n** x **i** (where 1 <= i <= 10 ) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

#### [Day 6] Let's Review

------------


Given a string, **S** , of length **N**  that is indexed from **0** to **N-1**, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  **2** space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

**Note:**  is considered to be an even index.

#### [Day 7] Arrays

------------


Given an array, **A**, of **N**  integers, print **A**'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
